  // If you need to perform an asynchronous operation during a Mocha function, then
  // you have two options. One is to return a promise and Mocha will honor that promise,
  // not continuing to the next step until the Promise is resolved. The second way is
  // to provide a callback function named "done" (the approach I'm using below).
  // If you provide the callback, then Mocha will not move on to the next step until
  // the "done" callback has been called. Here, I'm passing "done" directly to the
  // fs.writeFile function which will call done as soon as the file has been written.
  // This way, the tests won't start until the "database" file has been reset to an empty Array!

  // In Mocha we use the "describe" function to seperate our tests into sections.
  // The main purpose here is to make the console output easier to read. Each test
  // inside of a describe block will have its output indented inside of its description.
  // You can also place "before", "beforeEach", "after", and "afterEach" functions
  // inside of "describe" blocks and they will only run for tests inside the describe block.
